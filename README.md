# Carleton Math Code repository
This repository stores all code files that I use during my studies at Carleton for excercise purposes. Running the files is trivial.

## Why did I make this repo?
Two birds with one stone. I get to be challenged almost daily with new ideas, and I deepen my understanding in the courses that I take.
